### In this article, we will show you how to complete a manual installation of the OptiSigns Remote Agent on a Linux or Raspberry Pi device.

If you're running OptiSigns on a Windows, Linux or Raspberry Pi device, you can install optisigns-remote-agent add-on that will allow you to remotely control your device from the portal.

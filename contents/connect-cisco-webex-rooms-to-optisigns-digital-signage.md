Turn idle Cisco Webex Rooms, Boards, and Desks into digital signage. When the device is in Standby, OptiSigns plays your assigned content — images, videos, dashboards, web apps — and clears it instantly the moment a meeting starts.

This guide walks a Webex Full Administrator through the one-time setup at the organization level, and then per-room signage activation.

* * *

## What you'll need

  * **A Webex account** with the **Full Administrator** role for your organization. Any Webex tier with paired RoomOS devices is supported. (Required to approve OptiSigns in Webex Control Hub — read-only and device-only admins cannot consent.)
  * **An OptiSigns account.** [Sign up for a free trial](https://www.optisigns.com/free-trial) — you only pay for rooms you activate signage on.
  * **At least one compatible Cisco Webex device** paired to your Webex org. Digital Signage is supported across current Cisco **Board** , **Desk** , and **Room** Series devices running **RoomOS 11 or later** — for example Board Pro / Board Pro G2, Desk / Desk Mini / Desk Pro, Codec Pro / Codec EQ / Codec Plus, Room Bar / Room Bar Pro, Room Kit / Room Kit Mini / Room Kit EQX, and Room 55 / 70 / 70 G2. The Cisco **SX** and **DX** Series, the **Desk Hub** , and **Webex Share** are not supported. If you're unsure, see Cisco's [Digital signage device list](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nmd8log/Enable-digital-signage-on-Board,-Desk,-and-Room-Series-devices).
  * The device must be running in **Cisco RoomOS mode** — not Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) mode — so OptiSigns can control it over the RoomOS API.

* * *

## How OptiSigns works on Webex devices

OptiSigns uses the **Webex Digital Signage / Standby** feature built into RoomOS. We do not install an app on the device — instead, we set the device's signage URL via Webex's official Device Configurations API. Your content plays through the WebEngine browser only when the room is idle, and the device automatically returns to its normal meeting UI on any incoming call, scheduled meeting, or wake-on-presence.

There is no impact on meeting quality, screen-sharing, or Webex Assistant features.

## Which Webex devices appear in OptiSigns

OptiSigns shows your Webex **room systems** — the Cisco room devices that drive a meeting space (Room Kit, Room Bar, Board, and Desk models) running Cisco RoomOS. It doesn't list every device in your Webex organization.

These won't appear, by design:

Not listed | Why  
---|---  
Touch controllers (e.g. Cisco Touch 10) | They're the room's control panel, not a display.  
External monitors or TVs attached to a room device | They're outputs of the room system, not separate signage endpoints.  
IP phones, headsets, and other accessories | There's no display to show signage on.  
Devices running in **Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) mode** | The display is managed by Microsoft, so OptiSigns can't control signage on it. A device needs to be in Cisco RoomOS mode to appear here.  
  
**One room shows as one entry.** A meeting room appears as a single item — its room system. The touch panel and the display in that room are part of the same system, so a room with a codec, a Touch 10, and a monitor shows as **one** OptiSigns room, not three. If you were expecting a separate entry per device, this is why.

* * *

## Step 1 — Sign in to OptiSigns

Go to [**app.optisigns.com**](https://app.optisigns.com/) and sign in (or create your account).

* * *

## Step 2 — Open the Webex Rooms page

In the top navigation, open **Devices**. In the left sidebar under **Room Integrations** , click **Webex Rooms**. Since you haven't connected yet, you'll see the **Control Hub OAuth** card with everything you need to get started.

* * *

## Step 3 — Authorize OptiSigns in Cisco Control Hub

Click **View setup steps** to review exactly what OptiSigns will do and the permissions it needs, then click **Authorize in Cisco Control Hub**.

A new browser tab opens at Cisco Control Hub. Sign in as a **Webex Full Administrator** and approve the **OptiSigns Digital Signage** Service App for your organization. OptiSigns requests five scopes:

Scope | What it's for  
---|---  
`spark-admin:devices_read` | Reads the Webex Rooms inventory and device-group membership.  
`spark-admin:devices_write` | Pushes the signage URL to each Webex device via device configurations.  
`spark:xapi_commands` | Sends xAPI commands (refresh, restart app) over Service App tokens.  
`spark:xapi_statuses` | Reads device health signals (online state, peripheral status).  
`spark-admin:organizations_read` | Reads org metadata to sanity-check the Org ID you paste.  
  
![The Connect with Cisco Control Hub OAuth dialog — the four setup steps and all five required scopes](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53086189046803)

> If you see a permission error, you're not signed in as a Full Administrator. Ask your Webex admin to either approve OptiSigns for the org or grant you the Full Administrator role.

* * *

## Step 4 — Paste your Org ID and verify

Return to the OptiSigns tab. In the **Webex Organization ID** field, paste your organization's ID (find it in Control Hub under **Organization Settings → identifier**), then click **Verify Connection**.

OptiSigns mints Service App tokens and begins syncing. Within a few seconds the header flips to **Connected** , and your Webex rooms appear in the list alongside any Android, ChromeOS, or Linux signage devices on your account. Use **Sync now** any time to pull the latest inventory.

* * *

## Step 5 — Activate signage on a room

By default, rooms are listed but **not activated**. Activation is per-room billing — you pay only for rooms with signage turned on.

  1. Click any Webex room in the list to open its detail drawer.
  2. Click **Activate Signage License**. The drawer shows how many licenses are available.
  3. Confirm — your subscription updates immediately.

* * *

## Step 6 — Push content

With the room activated, you can assign content like any other OptiSigns screen. In the room drawer, click **Assign Content** (or **Change Content** if something is already playing), pick an **Asset** , **Playlist** , or **Schedule** , and save. The drawer shows what's currently playing and the room's signage URL.

![The activated room drawer — currently-playing content, Change Content and Remove Signage, and the signage URL](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53086235851027)

Walk to the device. Within 10–30 seconds, your content appears during Standby. Try a test call — content should clear instantly when the call connects.

* * *

## Configure signage behavior (optional)

In the room drawer, the **Webex Settings** card lets you tune how signage plays on that device:

Setting | What it does | Recommended  
---|---|---  
**Interaction Mode** | Whether touch on a Board/Desk wakes the device or interacts with content |  **Non-interactive (kiosk)** for lobby/info screens; **Interactive (touch)** for kiosk-style content  
**Auto-refresh** | How often the device reloads the signage URL (`0 = never`) | 30 minutes (default)  
**Mute** | Whether videos play with sound | Off (default)  
**Enable** | Master on/off for digital signage — disabling preserves the URL so you can re-enable later | On  
  
Click **Save** to apply. Changes reach the device within about 10 seconds via Webex's API.

## Disconnecting OptiSigns

**From OptiSigns:** Webex Rooms page → **Disconnect Cisco Webex**. This stops content delivery, releases the screen licenses, and removes the signage URL from all paired devices.

**From Webex Control Hub:** Apps & Integrations → OptiSigns Digital Signage → **Remove**. This revokes our access token. Use this if you want to fully de-authorize the integration.

* * *

## Troubleshooting

**My rooms don't appear after Verify Connection.** Wait 30 seconds and click **Sync now** — the initial inventory sync can take up to a minute on large orgs. If still empty, confirm you have at least one paired device on a WebEngine-capable model (see "What you'll need" above).

**Some of my Webex devices are missing from the list.** This is usually expected — OptiSigns lists your Webex room systems, not accessories like touch panels, monitors, or phones, and not devices running in Microsoft Teams Rooms mode. See Which Webex devices appear in OptiSigns for the full breakdown.

**Content shows but doesn't clear when a meeting starts.** This usually means Standby is disabled on the device. In Control Hub, open the device → Configurations → search "Standby" → ensure `Standby Control = On`.

**Content looks zoomed-in or cropped.** Webex Boards and Desks render at 1920×1080. Use OptiSigns' built-in resolution settings on the asset, or design content at 1920×1080 for safe rendering across all devices.

**I get an authorization error in Control Hub.** You're not signed in as a Full Administrator. Ask your Webex admin to either approve OptiSigns at the org level or grant your account the Full Administrator role.

**A specific device shows "WebEngine not enabled."** Open the device in Control Hub → Configurations → set `WebEngine.Mode = On`. OptiSigns will retry automatically.

## Pricing

The OptiSigns Webex Rooms integration uses a screen license just like any other OptiSigns screen. A free trial is available — you're only billed once you activate signage on a room. [See full pricing](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing).

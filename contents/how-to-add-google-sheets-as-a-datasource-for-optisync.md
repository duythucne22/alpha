## Adding Your Google Sheets as a DataSource

There are two different methods to adding Google Sheets to your DataSources:

#### **Method 1: Through Designer**

  * On the Files/Assets page, select **Designer** from the Apps
  * Select **DataSource** on the side menu, then **Add DataSource**
  * Click **Google Sheets**
  * Copy and Paste your Google Sheets URL into the provided text box, then **Import Data**
    * Note: You will be prompted to sign into your Google
  * Once your Google Sheets is imported into a table in our portal, click **Save**
  * **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
  * Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
  * Click **Done**

**Method 2: Through Account Settings**

  * In our portal, select your account name, then **More** , then **DataSources**
  * Select **Google Sheets** from the list of options
  * Copy and Paste your Google Sheets URL into the provided text box, then **Import Data**
    * Note: You will be prompted to sign into your Google
  * Once your Google Sheets is imported into a table in our portal, click **Update**
  * **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
  * Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
  * Click **Done**
  * Your **DataSource** will now be listed within your Advanced Account Settings

**Synchronization**

  * **Only import once:** This option imports the data only once when you add the DataSource. After the initial import, the data will not be updated automatically.
  * **Periodic direct access:** This option regularly fetches the latest data directly from the device through your gateway, providing "live access" to the data and ensuring you have the most up-to-date information available directly from the device. 
    * _This is better for more consistent update intervals, but could cause performance issues._
  * **Periodic background sync:** This option periodically syncs data to your server in the background at regular intervals, reducing the need for direct queries to the device.

**IMPORTANT**  
---  
OptiSync does not support special characters (i.e. anything outside the scope of an English-language keyboard). This will cause the system data to read as blank, and it will not show.  
  
**Update Interval**

_The duration of time between updates if you chose "Periodic direct access" or "Periodic background sync"_

  * None _(Your Datasource will import with the newest data available, but will not continuously update afterward. You will have to force refresh data for new updates.)_
  * 30 minutes
  * 1 hour
  * 8 hours

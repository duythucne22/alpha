Content Rotation App will allow you to mix content between 2 or more playlists and ensure a distribution of screen time for each playlists.

A real world scenario would be: there are 2 Departments each maintain a playlist: Department A and Department B.

  *     * Playlist: Select your playlist.
    * Rotate Every*: 1 means the system will play 1 items on this playlist then move on to next playlist
    * Each Item Duration*: Set duration for each items, this is required in case one playlist has a very long video for example, this will ensure screen time is still allocated fairly between playlists.

  * Enforce each item duration limit: Force each asset's playing time is same as Each Item Duration time. When this is checked, you will need to select how you want to handle when an item's duration is less than "Each item duration": 
    * Move to next: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will move to next
    * Repeat: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will repeat the same asset until the "Each item duration" is over.

Click Save.  
After Saving, you can Preview the Content Rotation to see how the system mix the playlist.

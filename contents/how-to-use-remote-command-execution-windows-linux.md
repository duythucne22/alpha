For section 2, you can enter the command you want to execute in the text box. The command needs to be OS-specific, depending on the OS your device is running on, you will need to build the scripts accordingly. Once you have your commands ready, just click the submit button. The command will be pushed to the devices for execution.

Other than the free-form scripts, there are some common commands built into the platform, to achieve these functions, you will just need to select it from the drop-down menu. Depending on the type of device OS, the command will be submitted accordingly.

## Controlling Remote Commands Received by the Device**  
**

In some cases, you may not want some of your devices to be controlled remotely for any reason. The ability to receive remote commands can be toggled on the device.

Go to the side menu on the OptiSigns player, click **Advanced Options** , and you'll find the toggle for **Execute Remote Commands**. Toggling this off will cause the device to reject remote commands.

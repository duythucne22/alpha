### **Hardware Troubleshooting**

Here, we will cover the most common hardware troubleshooting issues our support team encounters.

#### **Network Troubleshooting**

This is, by far, the most common issue people encounter. Devices experiencing network issues typically appear “Offline” in the OptiSigns portal, even when they are powered on and have content assigned to them.

![device offline optisigns portal](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/44652521300243)

**To identify and resolve network issues:**

  * Create a mobile hotspot, then have your OptiKiosk connect with it. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * Try a different network. You may need to move the device to get connected. A successful connection indicates a problem with your general Wi-Fi connection.
  * If you have firewalls, make sure OptiSigns is whitelisted. Refer to our [Whitelist Article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934) for the required URLs and ports.
  * Plug in an Ethernet cable to see if it can still connect.
  * After trying to connect with these methods, Factory Reset the device, then perform initial setup again.
  * If the device still cannot connect to any network, [contact our support team](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/35626165056787-How-to-Contact-OptiSigns-Support).

#### **Blank Screen Troubleshooting**

If your device and screen are on, but only displays a black screen:

  * Network issues, see above.
  * Check to make sure there is a Playlist or Asset assigned to your screen.
  * Make sure your Timezones and Schedules match, including your Operational Schedule and normal schedule.
  * Check your firewall settings, and ensure you’ve [Whitelisted OptiSigns IP addresses and ports](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047275934-Whitelist-OptiSigns-IP-addresses-ports).
  * Check your Operational Schedule, and verify its power settings are not set to Off. If an Operational Schedule’s power settings are set to Off, it will remain off during the designed time.

If the device is still not displaying content after you’ve checked these, try a Factory Reset.  

#### **App Freezes, Video Assets Not Playing Full Video, or Asset Not Loaded Fully**

To handle any of these issues, hit the Refresh & Relaunch option, then reboot. You may need to Factory Reset if the problem persists.

#### **Factory Reset**

If your kiosk is still operable, you can perform a soft factory reset directly from the system settings:

  1. Open the **Settings** app.
  2. Scroll down and select System.
  3. Tap Reset options.
  4. Choose Erase all data (factory reset).
  5. Confirm your choice to begin the reset.

This will erase all data from the kiosk’s internal storage, including Google accounts, system and app data, downloaded apps, music, photos, and any other user content. After the reset is complete, the device will restart with its original factory settings.

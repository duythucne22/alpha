2) Installation from server: if you don't have or don't want to use USB drive, just need to punch in the URL: <https://links.optisigns.com/lg> in your SI server TV settings (see detail below)

#### **Batch installation from the server URL with settings from a USB drive:**

Instead of typing in the URL and change settings for reach device, you can create USB drive to re-use it on many screens.  
1) Create a file named ‘scap_installation.json’ on your computer with this content:
    
    
       
    {  
    “serverIp” : “0.0.0.0”,  
    “serverPort” : 0,  
    “secureConnection” : false,  
    “fqdnMode” : true,  
    “fqdnAddr” : “https://links.optisigns.com/lg”,  
    “appLaunchMode” : “local”,  
    “appType” : “ipk”  
    }

2) Copy this file into the root of the USB drive   
3) Insert the USB drive into the device and start/reboot it  
4) Once the installation finish, restart the TV and OptiSigns app will AutoStart.

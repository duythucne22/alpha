**![additional commands menu](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071784723)**

### Remotely View Player Output

Using the Remote Control feature, it’s possible to view what’s actually playing on your device, and make changes via the device menu with a mouse.

This is different from the Preview feature, which shows an approximation of what an Asset or Playlist will look like on your screen. The Remote Control feature allows you to actually remote into the device and see what’s playing, and interact with the device software directly.

To do this, hit **More** from within the **Advanced** section of the **Edit Screen** menu:

![edit screen advanced menu more](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071786131)

Then, next to **Remote Control** , hit **Activate**.

![remote control activate](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071786771)

A pop up will appear asking if you’re sure you want to activate Remote Control. Hit **Activate**.

![remote control activate](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071787795)

Another box will appear informing you that it may take several seconds to fully remote into the device. Close this box, then scroll up to the main Remote Command area. Another option will have appeared: hit **Remote** to access the device.

![remote into device mdm button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071790483)

This will bring up a new browser window for you to view and control the device.

### Via Mobile Admin App

The OptiSigns [Mobile Admin App](https://www.optisigns.com/mobile-app) lets you remotely control your devices in the same way as above. Simply download the app, and access your digital signage hardware through your mobile device.

See our [Mobile Admin App article](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/30003143806099-How-to-Use-the-OptiSigns-Mobile-Admin-App) for more information.

## For Multiple OptiSigns Players

It’s possible to send basic remote commands to individual players, segments of OptiSigns players (defined via [tagging](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/38062664690195-Tagging-in-OptiSigns)), or all your OptiSigns players simultaneously. These commands allow for mass provisioning, updating, and troubleshooting. This section applies to Pro and ProMax players only, not the OptiStick.

The ability to do this needs to be activated. Simply contact us at [support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) to be given the ability to send remote commands.

### Enabling Remote Commands Feature on Account

Remote Command Execution is disabled by default. To use it, it will need to be turned on. To do this, navigate to[ the Preferences section](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/preference-settings) in the OptiSigns portal.

For security reasons, **only the account owner** can enable or disable Remote Command Execution.

![enabling remote commands on account](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071793427)

### How to Execute Remote Commands

To submit the command to manage the devices remotely, you will need to go to the remote command execution console. Click **Screens** , then the **More Options (Three Dots)**

Screens -> More Options Icon -> Execute Remote Commands

![more options execute remote commands](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071795219)

The Execute Remote Commands console can be broken down into three sections:

  * **Section 1** \- Where you specify the target of the commands.
  * **Section 2** \- The command you want to execute.
  * **Section 3** \- The execution result and history.

![execute remote commands steps](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590102885907)

For section 1, there are 2 types of targets you can choose from:

  * **Screens** \- You can select the screen name here, it can be one screen or multiple screens.
  * **Tags** \- Utilizing tags, you can execute the command on a group of devices. In the below example, the command will be submitted to all devices tagged as Windows or Raspberry Pi.

![target and tags execute remote commands](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071798035)

For section 2, you can enter the command you want to execute in the text box. The command needs to be OS-specific, depending on the OS your device is running on (Android for Android Stick, Linux for OptiSigns Pro / ProMax players), you will need to build the scripts accordingly. Once you have your commands ready, just click the submit button. The command will be pushed to the devices for execution.

Other than the free-form scripts, there are some common commands built into the platform, to achieve these functions, you will just need to select it from the drop-down menu. Depending on the type of device OS, the command will be submitted accordingly.

![refresh and relaunch](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/43590071799571)

After a command is executed, it will appear in section 3: the command history.

**NOTE**  
---  
The **Refresh & Relaunch **command can be used on any device. The **Reboot Device** command cannot be used on certain Android devices.  
  
### Controlling Remote Commands Received by Players

In some cases, you may not want some of your devices to be controlled remotely for any reason. The ability to receive remote commands can be toggled on the device.

Go to the side menu on the OptiSigns player, click **Advanced Options** , and you'll find the toggle for **Execute Remote Commands**. Toggling this off will cause the device to reject remote commands.

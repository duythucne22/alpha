Using GraphQL, it is possible to create a website asset on OptiSigns.

**NOTE**  
---  
At this time, this Mutation is primarily used to create or update Website assets.  
  
**1\. Creating a New Website Asset**

To do this, we’ll need to create a specific Mutation:
    
    
    mutation saveAsset ($payload: AssetInput!, $teamId: String)  
    {saveAsset (payload:$payload,teamId:$teamId){  
      _id  
      originalFileName  
      webLink  
      webType  
      fileType  
      }  
    }

**Variables:**
    
    
    {  
      "payload": {  
        "originalFileName": "",  
        "webLink": "",  
        "webType": "",  
        "fileType": ""  
      }  
    }

This Mutation, once run, will create a new asset:

This asset can now be assigned to a device, queried for additional information, or added to a playlist or schedule.

**2\. Updating Assets**

Updating assets is as simple as running the same Mutation while providing an _id field. This can be done for any asset type, not just website assets, but we will be using a website asset as an example.

**Variables:**
    
    
    {  
      "payload": {  
        "_id": "",  
        "originalFileName": "",  
        "webLink": "",  
        "webType": "",  
        "fileType": ""  
      }  
    }
